Game Design Document for Orion (working title) 0.0.1

Project goal:

The goal of the project is to create a team base multiplayer game. The game will be based around several space ships with their own movement and shooting mechanics that will define different classes and team roles. This setup may make the balancing difficult so it and may have to be refine or simplified. Each game will be played on a vast map, that may be randomly generated, consisting of several planets and a sun. The planets and sun will be in rough scale although we may find it necessary to cheat a little and make them smaller then they really would be. The planets will be the main objective of the game. When a player is near, or preforms some other action on, a planet that player will “capture” that planet for there team. The team with the most captured planets will earn points every few seconds. The goal of the game is to earn a set number of points before the other team. Players will use their ship to attack members of the other team. When a player is destroyed the will lost a point for there team. Other objects like moons, space stations, and asteroids will be in the game and will also be capture-able or some other action maybe performed upon them that will give players team or individual bonuses.
